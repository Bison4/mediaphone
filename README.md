MediaPhone
==========

MediaPhone is an Android storytelling and multimedia narrative application. It's available on the Google Play store as [Com-Phone](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ac.robinson.mediaphone ""), and a [simple manual (PDF)](http://digitaleconomytoolkit.org/manuals/com-phone.pdf "") is available.


What does it do?
----------------

Com-Phone helps you create multimedia narratives, combining photos, audio and text in exciting ways to tell digital stories. Send these to other devices running the application or play back locally; create templates, export as a movie, upload to YouTube, or save a web version to self-publish.

Each story can include any number of media frames. Each individual frame of the story can include an image, up to three layered audio tracks, and text content. All elements of each frame are optional. For example, Com-Phone can also be used as an annotated photo diary, a simple audio recorder, a text and sound tool for discussion about current events, or even a multimedia survey tool.

Com-Phone is open source as part of the Com-Me toolkit. For more information, and a simple flyer & manual, see: [http://digitaleconomytoolkit.org](http://digitaleconomytoolkit.org "").
